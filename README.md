## Algorithms performance in function of disk accesses

$L := Number \ of \ index \ levels$

$K := Number \ of \ overflow \ pages \ chained \ with \ a \ data \ page$

|    ```search(KeyType key)```     | $\mathcal{O}(L+K)$ |   Locates the ```key``` and then searches in ```all``` the chained pages    |            Locates the ```key``` and iterates over each chained data pages until the ```first``` record such that ```key = index(record)``` is found             |
| ```insert(RecordType& record)``` | $\mathcal{O}(L+K)$ | Locates the ```key``` and then looks for the ```first``` non-full data page | Locates the ```key``` and verifies in ```all``` chained pages if the ```key``` already exists and inserts the record at the ```first``` non-full data page found |

- When there is no space for a new record in a chain of record pages, a new overflow page is created and linked to previous overflow pages.
- ISAM tree is static; therefore, the number of disk accesses used to locate a key (known as $L$) is constant, as it never changes.
